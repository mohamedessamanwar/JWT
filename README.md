# JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

This repository provides a simple implementation and explanation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This README serves as a guide to understanding JWT, its structure, and its usage.

## Introduction

JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (`.`): the header, the payload, and the signature. These parts are Base64 encoded and concatenated with periods.

## JWT Structure

A JWT typically looks like the following:


Where:

- `xxxxx` represents the **Header**: It typically consists of two parts: the type of token (`JWT`) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
- `yyyyy` represents the **Payload**: This contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
- `zzzzz` represents the **Signature**: This is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way. The signature is created using the header, payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header.

## How JWT Works

JWTs are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web development. When a user logs in to an application, the server creates a JWT and sends it back to the client. The client then includes this JWT in the headers of subsequent requests to the server. The server can then validate the JWT and extract information from it to authorize the user and provide access to protected resources.

## Usage

To use JWT in your application, you'll typically need a library or package that can handle JWT encoding, decoding, and verification. Popular libraries are available for most programming languages and frameworks. Here's a simple example of using JWT in a Node.js application:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Create a JWT
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 123 }, 'secret');

// Verify and decode the JWT
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secret');
console.log(decoded); // { userId: 123 }
